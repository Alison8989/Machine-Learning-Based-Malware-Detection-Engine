Machine Learning & Endpoint Security - Seperating HYPE from value

3 BASIC but IMPORTANT requirements:

Accuracy: 
Since the solution will both intercept potential malware and provide information for future decision-
making, it must have a low rate of false positives. This is a result of analyzing a tremendous amount of raw data
– security analysts who establish baseline rules classify robust data sets. Ongoing training of the model similarly relies
on continuous access to large amounts of new data. But the rate of false positives can be extremely high if the data set is not robust.

It is important to note that the machine must have access to both benign and malicious data in order to accurately distinguish between the two. Training a model based solely on bad data increases the chance of high false-positive rates.

Ask the vendor:
• Upon how much data does the machine learning solution base its decisions? Is it enough?


• From where does the data come? Is there a wide variety of sources, or are they dependent on third-party threat aggregator sites?


• How often is the data collected?


• How often are new models trained and propagated to the customer?


• How is the system trained? Is it trained through a constant supply of rich data sets, so properties discovered can be used in future machine learning decisions?


• How does the vendor handle false positives?


• How does the vendor handle false negatives that the vendor later discovers (after the customer has run the malware)?

Speed: The solu on must quickly determine, with a high degree of certainty, that a threat has been detected. 

Ask the vendor:
• How quickly can the solution make a determination that leads to action?


• How quickly can it obtain enough relevant new data to influence the decisions it makes?

Efficiency: The solution must be accurate and fast, and it must support a productive end-user environment. Many solutions on the market today are slow, and they have a big impact on end-user productivity.

Ask the vendor:
• Where and how quickly does the analysis take place?


• What is the impact on the end-user system?


• What type of analysis is done on incoming files? On endpoints only, on cloud only, or a combination?


• Does it rely on post-event analysis (detecting rather than preventing)?
