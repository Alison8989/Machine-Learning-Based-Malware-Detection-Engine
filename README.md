## Questions to ask

### Accuracy

- Upon how much data does the machine learning solution base its decisions? Is it enough?

- From where does the data come? Is there a wide variety of sources, or are they dependent on third-party threat aggregator sites?

- How often is the data collected?

- How often are new models trained and propagated to the customer?

- How is the system trained? Is it trained through a constant supply of rich data sets, so properties discovered can be used in future machine learning decisions?

- How does the vendor handle false positives?

- How does the vendor handle false negatives that the vendor later discovers (after the customer has run the malware)?

### Speed

- How quickly can the solution make a determination that leads to action?

- How quickly can it obtain enough relevant new data to influence the decisions it makes?

### Efficiency

- Where and how quickly does the analysis take place?

- What is the impact on the end-user system?

- What type of analysis is done on incoming files? On endpoints only, on cloud only, or a combination?

- Does it rely on post-event analysis (detecting rather than preventing)?

## Rule of Thumb

- Ongoing training of the model similarly relies on continuous access to large amounts of new data. 

- The rate of false positives can be extremely high if the data set is not robust. 

- It is important to note that the machine must have access to both benign and malicious data in order to accurately distinguish between the two. 

- ? Training a model based solely on bad data increases the chance of high false-positive rates.
